    took place to the user.

            4-d direction vector of ray in homogeneous coordinates
        pos : `numpy.ndarray`
            4-d position of last interaction pf the photons with any optical element in
            homogeneous coordinates. Together with ``dir`` this determines the equation
            of the ray.
        energy : float
            Photon energy in keV.
        polarization : float
            Polarization angle of the photons.
        probability : float
            Probability that the photon continues. Set to 0 if the photon is absorbed, to 1 if it
            passes the optical element and to number between 0 and 1 to express a probability that

    keyword respectively to each CCD

        Transformation to bring an element from the default position (see description of

    position : 3-d vector in real space

    orientation : Rotation matrix or ``None``
        Relative orientation of the base vectors of this optical
        element relative to the orientation of the coordinate system
        of the spacecraft. The default is no rotation (i.e. the axes of both
        coordinate systems are parallel).
    zoom : float or 3-d vector
        Scale the size of an optical element in each dimension by ``zoom``. If ``zoom`` is a scalar,
        the same scale is applied in all dimesions. This only affects the oter dimensions of
        the optical element, not internal scales like the pixel size or grating constant (if
