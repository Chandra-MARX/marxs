def intersect_line_plane(p_line, h_plane):
    '''Intersect a line in Pluecker coordinates with a plane in homogeneous coordinates.

    This function returns the position of the intersection.
    If the line is parallel (but not idendical) to the plane that intersection
    happens "at infinity" and thus the last component of the intersection
    coordinate is 0. If the line is in the plane, then all components of the
    return vector are 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p_line : np.array (last dimension has 6 elements)
        Pluecker coordinates of a line or an array of lines
    h_plane : np.array with ``shape=(4, )``
        Homogeneous coordinates of a plane.

    Returns
    -------
    h_point : np.array
        Homogeneous coordinates of the intersection points of line and plane.
        Has the same shape as ``p_line``, but the last dimension has only 4
        elements.
