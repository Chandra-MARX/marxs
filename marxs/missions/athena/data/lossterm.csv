#      Based on Richard Willingale's calculation; see
#      rw_Athena_Mirror_v3.1_v2.1.pdf
#      (Version 2.1, September 9th, 2020)
#      Additional loss terms included:
#      1) Fixed length of SPO MM despite changing radius of curvature within SPO MM itself
#      2) Using -1/+1 wedges rather than optimal (but un-manufacturable) +1/+3 wedges
#      3) Alignment/Figure/Roughness within an SPO stack itself (<1% loss)
#      4) Axial gap geometry (between primary and secondary stacks in a SPO MM, ~0.6mm) 
#      5) Use of parallel rather than converging ribs within SPO stack.  (~3.5% loss)
