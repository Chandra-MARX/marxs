class FlatBrewsterMirror(FlatOpticalElement):
    '''Flat mirror operated at the Brewster angle.

    Calculation of the Fresnel coefficients can be computationally intense
    and also requires knowledge of the refractive index for the appropriate material.
    The ``FlatBrewsterMirror`` simplifies this for a mirror that is known to be
    operated at the Brewster angle.

    This mirror assumes that all photons arrive at the Brewster angle
    where only s (senkrecht = direction perpendicular to plane of incidence)
    polarisation is reflected.
    It also fully assumes that all photons that are not reflected (i.e. those that
    are transmitted) are lost. No transmitted photons are returned, instead the
    probability of the reflected photons is adjusted to account for this overall loss.

class MultiLayerEfficiency(FlatOpticalElement):

    The distance between layers (and thus best reflected energy) changes along
    the local y axis.
    All reflectivity data is assumed to be for a single, desired angle. There
    is currently no way to enter varying reflection that depends on the angle
    of incidence.
    There is a default size of 49mm by 24mm, but this can be overridden by
    entering a different value for zoom.

    Provide reflectivity data in a file with columns:

    - 'X(mm)' - position along the "changing" axis (local y axis)
    - 'Peak lambda' - wavelength with maximum reflection at a given position
    - 'Peak' - maximum reflection at a given position
    - 'FWHM(nm)' - full width half max, measure of width of reflection Gaussian peaks

    Provide polarization data in a file with columns:

    - 'Photon energy' - energy of the photon in keV
    - 'Polarization' - Fraction polarized in the more reflective direction, so that
      randomly polarized light would have a value of 0.5.
