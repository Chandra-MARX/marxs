    '''Base class for all optical elements in marxs.

    This class cannot be used to instanciate an optical element directly, rather it serves as a
    base class from with other optical elements will be derived.

    At the very minumum, any derived class needs to implement `__call__` which
    typically calls `intersect` and either `process_photon` or
    `process_photons`. If the interaction with the photons (e.g. scattering of
    a mirror surface) can be implemented in a vectorized way using numpy array
    operations, the derived class should overwrite `process_photons`
    (`process_photon` is not used in this case).  If no vectorized
    implementation is available, it is sufficient to overwrite
    `process_photon`.  Marxs will call `process_photons`, which (if not
    overwritten) contains a simple for-loop to loop over all photons in the
    array and call `process_photon` on each of them.

        This is called from the `process_photons` method in a loop over all

        into the photon list. ``process_photon`` can return any number of

        which column these numbers should be inserted.

        ----------
        dir : `numpy.ndarray`
            4-d direction vector of ray in homogeneous coordinates
        pos : `numpy.ndarray`
            4-d position of last interaction pf the photons with any optical element in

            of the ray.

        polarization : float
            Polarization angle of the photons.

        probability : float
            Probability that the photon passes this optical element. Set to 0 if the
            photon is absorbed, to 1 if it passes and to number between 0 and 1 to
            express a probability that the photons passes.

    This class is meant to simplify the specification of a single physical
    element, that fullfills several logical functions, e.g. a detector can be seen
    as a a sequence of a contamination layer (which modifies the probability of a photon
    reaching the CCD), a QE filter (which modifies the probability of detecting the photon),
    and the pixelated CCD (which sorts the photons in pixels). All these things can be
    approximated as happening in the same physical spotlocation, and thus it is convenient to
    treat all three functions as one element.

    Parameters
    ----------
    elements : list of classes
        List of class names specifying the layers in the stack
    keywords : list of dicts

        of individual elements)

    Examples
    --------
