class OrderSelector(object):
    '''Select from a list of order number independent of energy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    orderlist : array
        This are the order numbers to chose from. They must be integers.
    p : None or array
        Probability for a photon to end up in each order. The sum of all probabilities
        can be smaller than 1, if a certain fraction of photons is absorbed by
        the grating. If this is ``None`` equal probability is assigned to all orders.

    Examples
    --------
    Two common use cases for testing are a grating where every photon gets
    diffracted into the same order or where all photons get distributed with
    equal probability into a set of orders.

class FlatGrating(FlatOpticalElement):
    '''Flat grating

    The grating is assumed to be geometrically thin, i.e. all photons enter on
    the face of the grating, not through the sides.

    Parameters
    ----------
    d : float or callable
        grating constant in mm. If ``d`` is callable, then it will be called as
        ``d(intercoos)``, where ``intercoos`` is a (N, 2) array holding the
        positions where photons hit the gratings in the local coordinate system.
        This can be used to simulate manufacturing uncertainties or intentional
        grating period variation. The callable has to return a vector of lengths N
        that contains the grating constant for each photon in mm.
    order_selector : callable
        A function or callable object that accepts arrays of photon energy, polarization
        and the blaze angle
        as input and returns arrays for grating order (integer)
        and probability (float). The probabiliy expresses the chance that the photon passes
        the grating and is not absorbed, e.g. if the probability that a photon at energy E ends
        up in order=[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2] is [0, 0, .5, .3, .0] , then the returned probability for
        all photons should be 0.8.
    transmission : bool
        Set to ``True`` for a transmission grating and to ``False`` for a
        reflection grating. (*Default*: ``True`` )
    groove_angle : float
        Angle between the local z axis and the direction of the grooves in radian.
        (*Default*: ``0.``)

    .. warning::
       Reflection gratings are untested so far!

    def order_sign_convention(self, p):

        This sets the following, somewhat arbitrary convention:
        Positive grating orders will are displaced along the local :math:`\hat e_z` vector,
        negative orders in the opposite direction. If the grating is rotated by :math:`-\pi`
        the physical situation is the same, but the sign of the grating order will be reversed.
        In this sense, the convention chosen is arbitrarily. However, it has some practical
        advantages: The implementation is fast and all photons passing through the grating
        in the same diffraction order are displaced in the same way. (Contrary to the
        convention in :class:`CATGrating`.)
        ``order_sign_convention`` has to be a callable that accepts an array
        of eukledian direction vectors as input and returns ``+1``, ``-1``,
