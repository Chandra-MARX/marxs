Multi-Architecture-Raytrace-Xraymission-Simulator (MARXS)
=========================================================

.. include:: ../DESCRIPTION.rst

The documentation for MARXS is split into several parts. First, it explains how to use MARXS to simulate an (astronomical) observation for an existing instrument configuration, e.g. from the examples distributed with MARX or provided by an instrument team. The second section is aimed at instrument teams and proposers.
